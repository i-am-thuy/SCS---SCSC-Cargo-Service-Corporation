## SSCS is anticipated to be a safe investment choice due to the following factors: 
(1) the market in which the firm competes is an oligopoly with just two companies (SCS and TCS, Tan Son Nhat Cargo Services Co.Ltd). 

(2) Strong financial standing; no debts. 

(3) At Noi Bai Airport, the business is executing M&A projects with freight companies, and SCS is providing the Airports Corporation of Vietnam (ACV) with experience in the arrangement of air cargo, which is a plus point for SCS to win the contract at Long Thanh airport (expected to operate in 2025).

But you need to keep an eye on the geopolitical war Russia against Ukraine and Fed interest rates increasing influence, in order to make wise investment decisions.
